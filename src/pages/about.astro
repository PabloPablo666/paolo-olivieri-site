  <h1>About</h1>

  <div class="card">
    <p>
      I am a <strong>sound engineer</strong> with a degree in <strong>Audio Production</strong>.
      My work is grounded in fundamentals: gain staging, dynamics, tonal balance,
      stereo image, translation, and repeatable workflows.
    </p>

    <p class="muted">
      I build tools to reduce uncertainty, not to add features.
    </p>
  </div>

  <h2>Focus</h2>
  <div class="card">
    <ul>
      <li>Critical listening and technical decision-making</li>
      <li>Dynamics and loudness control (with visible trade-offs)</li>
      <li>Stereo / mono / M-S monitoring and translation checks</li>
      <li>Predictable signal paths and debuggable behaviour</li>
    </ul>
  </div>

  <h2>Tool building</h2>
  <div class="card">
    <p>
      My tools come from practical problems encountered while working with audio:
      previewing material reliably, verifying tempo and pitch behaviour,
      and making decisions before committing to irreversible processing.
    </p>

    <p class="muted">
      If a tool tries to do everything, it usually fails at the important parts.
      I prefer minimal interfaces backed by clear, technical behaviour.
    </p>
  </div>

  <h2>Audio</h2>
  <div class="card">
    <p>
      I publish DJ mixes and audio material on SoundCloud.
      This is part of the process: testing ears, tools, and assumptions
      in real listening contexts.
