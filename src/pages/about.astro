  <h1>About</h1>

  <div class="card">
    <p>
      I am a <strong>sound engineer</strong> with a degree in <strong>Audio Production</strong>.
      My work is grounded in audio fundamentals: gain staging, dynamics, tonal balance,
      stereo image, translation and repeatable workflows.
    </p>

    <p class="muted">
      I build tools because I want specific behaviours and reliable references,
      not because I want “features”.
    </p>
  </div>

  <h2>Focus</h2>
  <div class="card">
    <ul>
      <li>Critical listening and technical decision-making</li>
      <li>Dynamics and loudness control (without hiding the costs)</li>
      <li>Stereo/mono/M-S monitoring and translation checks</li>
      <li>Predictable signal paths and debuggable behaviour</li>
    </ul>
  </div>

  <h2>Tool building</h2>
  <div class="card">
    <p>
      My tools originate from practical problems: reliable preview, physically coherent
      pitch/tempo behaviour, and workspaces that reduce uncertainty before committing
      to irreversible processing.
    </p>

    <p class="muted">
      If a tool tries to do everything, it usually fails at the important parts.
      I prefer minimal interfaces backed by clear, technical behaviour.
    </p>
  </div>

  <h2>Audio</h2>
  <div class="card">
    <p>
      I publish DJ mixes and audio material on SoundCloud. This is part of the process:
      testing ideas, ears and tools in real listening contexts, not just in theory.
