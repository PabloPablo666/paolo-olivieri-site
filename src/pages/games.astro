    A small selection of academic projects and interactive experiments developed during university.

  <h2>Tent City</h2>
  <div class="card">
    <p>
      <strong>Tent City</strong> was a university project originally conceived as an
      environmental audio experiment.
    </p>

    <p>
      The initial goal was to populate a virtual environment with
      spatialised ambient sound sources, focusing on atmosphere,
      perception and environmental storytelling rather than gameplay.
    </p>

    <p>
      As development progressed, the project naturally expanded.
      Driven by experimentation and technical curiosity, interactive
      mechanics were introduced, eventually transforming the prototype
      into a first-person experience with a loosely structured narrative layer.
    </p>

    <p class="muted">
      The final build reflects this exploratory process: part sound-driven environment,
      part experimental FPS, with an intentionally rough structure typical of academic
      prototyping.
    </p>

    <p class="muted">
      The project includes known limitations and unresolved behaviours,
      which are preserved here as part of its development history.
    </p>

  <h2>C# Text Adventure</h2>
  <div class="card">
    <p>
      A text-based adventure developed in C# as part of coursework,
      focused on state management, branching logic and command parsing.
    </p>

    <p>
      The original project was written entirely in C#, with a simple
      engine handling player input, world state and narrative progression.
    </p>

    <p class="muted">
      For this website, the game is presented as a lightweight browser
      adaptation that reproduces the interaction model and structure of
      the original implementation.
