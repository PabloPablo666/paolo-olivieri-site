    Critical listening & pre-master evaluation workspace
  </p>

  <div class="card">
    <p>
      Audio Bench is a focused listening and analysis environment designed
      to evaluate audio material <strong>before</strong> final mastering
      or release.
    </p>

    <p>
      It runs entirely in the browser and requires no installation,
making it immediately accessible on desktop and mobile devices.
Audio processing runs locally, and audio files are never uploaded to a server.
    </p>

    <p class="muted">
      The purpose is not to enhance or fix the sound, but to provide
      a fast and reliable reference to understand what is actually
      happening in the signal before any irreversible processing.
    </p>
  </div>

  <h2>What it is built for</h2>
  <div class="card">
    <ul>
      <li>Critical listening and technical verification</li>
      <li>Pre-master and gain staging evaluation</li>
      <li>Stereo, mono, mid and side monitoring</li>
      <li>Dynamic range and loudness inspection</li>
      <li>Vinyl-aware preview and low-end compatibility checks</li>
      <li>Quick reference checks without installing dedicated software</li>
    </ul>
  </div>

  <h2>Design principles</h2>
  <div class="card">
    <ul>
      <li>No automatic correction or “smart” processing</li>
      <li>No creative enhancement or sound shaping</li>
      <li>Brickwall limiting with predictable, transparent behavior</li>
      <li>Clear and readable metering (RMS, LUFS, True Peak)</li>
      <li>Offline export matching the realtime monitoring engine</li>
      <li>Consistent behavior across desktop and mobile browsers</li>
    </ul>
  </div>

  <h2>Objective</h2>
  <div class="card">
    <p>
      Provide a reliable and immediately accessible technical reference
      to evaluate audio material before final mastering, without altering
      it in ways that cannot be undone.
    </p>

    <p class="muted">
      In short: listen clearly, anywhere, before committing.
    </p>
  </div>

  <h2>Status</h2>
  <div class="card">
    <p>
      <strong>Work in progress</strong> — the core audio engine is stable
      and functional. Interface refinement, workflow improvements and
      additional monitoring tools are under active development.
