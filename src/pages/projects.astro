    Small set of tools built for real workflows: crate digging, listening, analysis,
    and predictable audio behaviour. If a project grows into a cathedral, it gets trimmed.

      desc="A critical listening & pre-mastering workspace. Built to verify balance, dynamics, stereo image, loudness and vinyl-safety before final mastering. No magic presets: clear metering, controlled limiting (true peak), monitoring modes (stereo/mono/M/S) and an offline export that matches the realtime engine."
